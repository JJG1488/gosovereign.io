## Account Security

### Password Storage

### Session Management
Sessions expire after 30 days of inactivity. Customers can log out from any device.

### Data Privacy
Customers can delete their account, which removes all personal data.

## Tips

### Encourage Registration

- Mention order tracking benefits
- Highlight faster checkout
- Offer loyalty discounts to members

### Support Requests

When customers contact you, ask for:
- Order number (not password)
- Email address on account

### Guest Conversion

After a guest purchase, the success page prompts:
"Create an account to track your order"

This captures customers who prefer to browse anonymously but may want accounts after buying.
