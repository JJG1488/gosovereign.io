# Coupons

Create discount codes to run promotions and reward customers.

## Creating a Coupon

1. Go to **Admin > Coupons**
2. Click **Add Coupon**
3. Configure the coupon settings

### Coupon Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Code** | The code customers enter (e.g., SAVE20) |
| **Discount Type** | Percentage or fixed amount |
| **Discount Value** | Amount off (e.g., 20 for 20% or $20) |
| **Minimum Order** | Minimum cart total required |
| **Usage Limit** | Maximum times coupon can be used |
| **Start Date** | When coupon becomes active |
| **Expiry Date** | When coupon expires |

## Discount Types

### Percentage Discount

Takes a percentage off the order total.

**Example:** 20% off
- Cart total: $100
- Discount: $20
- Customer pays: $80

### Fixed Amount Discount

Takes a fixed dollar amount off.

**Example:** $15 off
- Cart total: $100
- Discount: $15
- Customer pays: $85

## Usage Limits

Control how many times a coupon can be used:

- **Unlimited** - No restrictions
- **Limited** - Set maximum uses (e.g., 100)

The usage counter shows how many times the coupon has been redeemed.

## Minimum Order Amount

Require a minimum cart total before the coupon applies.

**Example:** $10 off orders over $50
- Customer with $40 cart: Coupon rejected
- Customer with $60 cart: $10 discount applied

## Date Restrictions

### Start Date
Schedule a coupon to activate in the future. Useful for planned promotions.

### Expiry Date
Set when the coupon stops working. Customers see "This coupon has expired" if they try to use it after.

## Coupon Codes

### Best Practices

- Use memorable codes: `WELCOME10`, `SUMMER2024`, `FREESHIP`
- Keep codes short: Easier to type and share
- Avoid confusing characters: Skip 0/O and 1/I/L

### Examples

| Purpose | Code Example |
|---------|--------------|
| New customer discount | `WELCOME15` |
| Seasonal sale | `SUMMER25` |
| Free shipping | `SHIPFREE` |
| Holiday promotion | `HOLIDAY20` |
| Influencer code | `JANE10` |

## Customer Experience

### Applying a Coupon

1. Customer adds items to cart
2. On cart page, enters coupon code

Customers see helpful error messages:
