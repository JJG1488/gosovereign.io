# Custom Domains

Use your own domain name for your store instead of `yourstore.gosovereign.io`.

> **Pro Feature:** Custom domains are available on Pro and Hosted tiers. [Compare tiers](/docs/tiers)

## Overview

By default, your store is hosted at:
```
https://yourstore.gosovereign.io
```

With a custom domain, customers visit:
```
https://shop.yourbrand.com
```

## Requirements

Before setting up a custom domain:

1. **Own a domain** - Purchase from a registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, Cloudflare, etc.)
2. **Have Pro or Hosted tier** - Custom domains require an upgrade
3. **Access DNS settings** - You'll add a DNS record

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Add Domain in Settings

1. Go to **Admin > Settings**
2. Click the **Domain** tab
3. Enter your custom domain (e.g., `shop.yourbrand.com`)
4. Click **Add Domain**

### Step 2: Configure DNS

Add a CNAME record at your domain registrar:

| Type | Name | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| CNAME | shop | cname.vercel-dns.com |

**Examples by subdomain:**

| Your Domain | Name Field |
|-------------|------------|
| shop.example.com | shop |
| store.example.com | store |
| www.example.com | www |

### Step 3: Verify

After adding the DNS record:

1. Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation
2. Return to Settings > Domain
3. Click **Verify Domain**
4. Status changes to "Connected"

## Using Root Domain

To use your root domain (e.g., `yourbrand.com` without www):

1. Add an A record instead of CNAME:

| Type | Name | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| A | @ | 76.76.21.21 |

2. Add the domain in Settings as usual

## SSL/HTTPS

SSL certificates are automatic:

1. Domain is verified
2. Certificate is issued within minutes
3. HTTPS works automatically
4. HTTP redirects to HTTPS

No action required on your part.

## Troubleshooting

### "Domain not verified"

- DNS changes can take up to 48 hours
- Double-check the CNAME value is exactly `cname.vercel-dns.com`
- Ensure no typos in the domain name

### "SSL error"

- Wait 10-15 minutes after verification
- Certificate issuance is automatic but not instant

### "Site not loading"

- Clear browser cache
- Try incognito/private mode
- Check DNS propagation: [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net)

## Multiple Domains

You can add multiple domains to one store:

- `shop.yourbrand.com`
- `store.yourbrand.com`
- `yourbrand.shop`

All domains serve the same store content.

## Removing a Domain

1. Go to Settings > Domain
2. Click the X next to the domain
3. Confirm removal

Your store continues working at `yourstore.gosovereign.io`.

## Tips

### Subdomain vs Root Domain

**Subdomain (shop.example.com):**
- Easier to set up (simple CNAME)
- Clear purpose
- Good for businesses with main website

**Root domain (example.com):**
- More memorable
- Requires A record
- Best when store is your main site

### DNS Providers

Each registrar has different interfaces. Search "[your registrar] add CNAME record" for specific instructions.

### Propagation Time

DNS changes typically take:
- 5-30 minutes for most users
- Up to 48 hours in rare cases
- Varies by ISP and location
