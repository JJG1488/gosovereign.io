## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I upgrade later?

Yes! You can upgrade from Starter to Pro at any time. You'll pay the difference in price, and your store will be redeployed with the new features unlocked.

### What happens if I cancel Hosted?

If you cancel your Hosted subscription, your store continues to work until the end of your billing period. After that, you can download your store as a ZIP file and self-host it.

### Do I own my store?

Absolutely. Every GoSovereign store can be downloaded as a complete Next.js application. You can self-host it anywhere - Vercel, Netlify, your own server. No lock-in.

### What payment methods are supported?

All stores use Stripe for payments. Stripe supports credit cards, debit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and more. You connect your own Stripe account and receive funds directly.

### Are there transaction fees?

GoSovereign does not charge transaction fees. You only pay Stripe's standard processing fees (typically 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction).
